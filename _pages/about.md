<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Lingxiao Wang(王 凌霄), now a  <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/members/lingxiao-wang'>Research Scientist（研究員） in RIKEN-iTHEMS</a> (理化学研究所 数理創造研究センター). My research interest includes Machine Learning in Physics (especially high energy nuclear physics, e.g., QCD Matter, Lattice QCD, etc.), Collective Behavior and Atomspheric Sciences. 

Now, I'm the main facilitator of a working group of <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/about/working-groups/deep-in-wg'>"DEEP-IN" in RIKEN-iTHEMS</a>, which aims to develop deep learning models for solving inverse problems in sciences.

I have organized many "machine learning physics" seminars for physicists online, find the previous activities in our page <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/deep-in-wg/achieve'>MLP club</a>. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me via lingxiaowang[at]foxmail.com.
