<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Lingxiao Wang (王 凌霄), currently a <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/members/lingxiao-wang'>Research Scientist（研究員） at RIKEN iTHEMS</a> (理化学研究所 数理創造研究センター). Starting from November 2025, I will also serve as an Assistant Professor at  <a href='https://www.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/lp/ipi/'>the Institute for Physics of Intelligence (iPi), the University of Tokyo</a>.

My research interests span **Machine Learning in Physics**—particularly in **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** (e.g., QCD matter, Lattice QCD, etc.)—as well as **Collective Behavior** and **Atmospheric Sciences**.  

At RIKEN iTHEMS, I am the main facilitator of the <a href='https://ithems.riken.jp/en/about/working-groups/deep-in-wg'>"DEEP-IN" working group</a>, which focuses on developing deep learning models to tackle inverse problems in science. I have also organized numerous *Machine Learning in Physics* seminars for the community; past activities can be found on our <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/deep-in-wg/achieve'>MLP club page</a>.  

If you are interested in academic collaboration, please feel free to contact me via **lingxiaowang[at]foxmail.com**.
